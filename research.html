    	<h4> Early warning indicators for tipping points </h4>
        <div class="research-div">
		  <img src="images/balancing_rock.jpg" class="img-right"><p> A tipping point is a 
		  threshold at which a system transitions to a contrasting stable state. They exist 
		  across all varieties of natural and artificial systems. In general, models are 
		  not able to accurately predict where these tipping points are located, due to 
		  inevitable uncertainties in model parameters. However, there are some generic 
		  statistical properties that systems exhibit as they approach tipping points that 
		  are a consequence of the dynamical phenomena known as 'critical slowing down'. 
		  Detecting these 'early warning indicators' in time-series data could allow for 
		  timely intervention to prevent or at least prepare for the regime shift. We are 
		  working on early warning signals that are specific to bifurcation types, and 
		  assessing their utility in high-dimensional systems where identifying the 
		  relevant variables becomes important.</p>

	    <h4> Stability of complex systems </h4>
        <div class="research-div">
		  <img src="images/network2.jpg" class="img-right"><p>Complex systems are comprised of many components that interact according to various mechanisms. An ecosystem is comprised of many species that are connected via competitive, cooperative and inhibitive interactions. Financial systems are comprised of banks, hedge funds and regulators that interact through monetary transactions. Such systems are prone to catastrophic shifts as we have seen from the collapse of the Canadian Newfoundland cod fishery in 1992 and the global financial crisis of 2007-2008. I am working with results from random matrix theory and properties of dynamical systems on networks to determine interaction mechanisms and network structures that result in enhanced stability of complex systems. An understanding of what makes complex networks robust to disturbances is relevant across a wide range of fields and for the sustainability of complex systems vital to human well-being.</p>

	    <h4> Infectious disease modelling </h4>
        <div class="research-div">
		  <img src="images/disease.jpg" class="img-right-border"><p>There is a long history of using compartmental models to understand the population-level transmission of infectious disease. I am particularly interested in the dynamics of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, that are close to elimination, but survive due to pockets of non-vaccinating individuals. Models that couple human behaviour (regarding vaccination) to disease dynamics elucidate a tipping point, that if crossed, results in continuous outbreaks and drastically delays eradication targets. We have found evidence of critical slowing down in time-series of tweets preceding the DisneyLand measles outbreak suggesting that this coupled socio-disease system does indeed exhibit critical phenomena. Further work will investigate the potential for critical slowing down metrics in twitter data to assess population resilience to vaccine scares.</p>

	    <h4> Socio-climate models </h4>
        <div class="research-div">
		  <img src="images/co2_emissions.jpg" class="img-right"><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) consistently base climate change predictions using models that do not account for dynamic human behaviour regarding carbon emissions. In coupling a behavioural model, that captures the fundamental tendency for humans to learn socially, to a recognised simple climate model, we get substantially different predictions of global temperature depending on social parameter settings. These results suggest that future climate models should incorporate human behaviour when making predictions. we are investigating different model frameworks for behavioural dynamics, and the corresponding impact this has on climate predictions. Of particular interest is recognising thresholds in the socio-climate system that partition the onset versus suppression of runaway climate change.</p>

	    <h4> Continuous bioprocesses </h4>
        <div class="research-div">
		  <img src="images/bioreactor2.png" class="img-right"><p>Continuous bioprocesses use complete living cells or their components (e.g. bacteria, enzymes) to obtain biological products used in the pharmaceutical industry. The reaction process can exhibit a range of complex dynamics including multi-stability and threshold behaviour entailing a possible transition to a wash-out state (zero product output). As with most complex systems, these thresholds are difficult to identify and so we are investigating the use and practicality of early warning indicators in this field (see above). It so happens that many of these reaction schemes are optimised in the proximity of their tipping points and so early warning indicators could provide a measure of risk that complements current bioprocess techniques.</p>
