		<h3> Student Testimonials </h3>
		<br> 
		
		<h4>Andrea<!-- Choi -->, MATH 128, Winter 2018</h4>
		<blockquote>"Tom helped me a lot and was always patient and communicated the topics that I was having trouble with clearly.  He knows how to break down tougher concepts into simpler ones that are easier to understand.  I'm pretty sure I learned more from him than in class.  He is reliable and answers emails in a timely fashion, and is accommodating - (we did a skype session when I wasn't in Waterloo).  He is a great and enthusiastic tutor, and is willing to help you succeed."</blockquote>
		
		<h4>Emily<!-- Champion-->, MATH 128, Winter 2018</h4>
		<blockquote>"Tom was great at narrowing down on the little details in my understanding that caused me to misunderstand or have difficulties with a problem. There were topics that completely flew over my head in lecture that almost seemed easy after a session. I have never had math make so much sense to me  and I far surpassed my final-grade goal."</blockquote>
		
		
		<h4>Evan<!-- Scott-->, MATH 104, Fall 2017</h4>
		<blockquote>"Tom tutored me for MATH 104 (Calculus for the Arts and Social Sciences) for the Fall 2017 term at the University of Waterloo. Before his assistance, I was receiving an average of about 30% on my weekly quizzes, give or take about 10%. When I started my sessions with him, I saw my performance sharply increase, as indicated by a mark of 85% on my midterm. That’s a difference of at least 45%! You’ve heard it quantitatively, now let’s illustrate how Tom gets these results. First, he’s always punctual (even when I wasn’t), but he’s modest to a fault, so I never felt intimidated by the idea of looking bad for showing up late, having not done much between sessions, or showing up unprepared. Tom has a way of making the learning experience personal, so as to forego the insecurities of a judgemental learning environment, and instead to just focus on exposure to/understanding of the content. I’ve found in my experience that the number one reason why much of my work doesn’t get complete is due to the fact that I am usually too afraid/insecure to ask for help, and working with Tom, that insecurity is substantially mitigated.
          Beyond his constructive attitude, I’ve noticed that Tom is adept at understanding his clients’ thought processes when it comes to solving problems. He efficiently identified the discrepancies in my comprehension, and presented the problem-solving methods in multiple ways so that we found the ones with which I felt most comfortable.
          Tips for working with Tom: Be VOCAL. He is best able to understand how you think if you tell him exactly what you are thinking all the time (as long as it’s relevant to the material), no matter how confident you are in your understanding.
          Ask about little, seemingly insignificant details. They might be the key to unlocking aethereal knowledge of the topic.
          Do not worry about looking stupid. We once had a decent giggle at the fact that I had been trying to add 2 to 5 to get 8 for about 5 minutes. Remember that most mathematical geniuses are actually terrible at basic arithmetic (though this is by no means advocating me as a mathematical genius).
          Do the three things listed above during your sessions, and you should see dramatic improvement. Practice at home as well if you find the time. It always helps."</blockquote>

		<h4>Shaun<!-- Groulx-->, CIVE 222, Summer 2016</h4>
		<blockquote>"I was taking a differential equations course at the University Of Waterloo and needed a tutor bad as I found it challenging. I tried two other Tutors before Tom, but Toms ability to communicate effectively, at a level I can understand, along with his brilliance in Math makes him a great teacher. I would highly recommend him."</blockquote>
